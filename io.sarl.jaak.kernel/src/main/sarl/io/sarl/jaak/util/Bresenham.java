	 * integer addition, subtraction and bit shifting, all of which are
	 * very cheap operations in standard computer architectures. It is one of the
	 * earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. A minor extension
	 * to the original algorithm also deals with drawing circles.
	 * <p>
	 * While algorithms such as Wu's algorithm are also frequently used in modern
	 * computer graphics because they can support antialiasing, the speed and
	 * simplicity of Bresenham's line algorithm mean that it is still important.
	 * The algorithm is used in hardware such as plotters and in the graphics
	 * chips of modern graphics cards. It can also be found in many software
	 * graphics libraries. Because the algorithm is very simple, it is often
	 * implemented in either the firmware or the hardware of modern graphics cards.
